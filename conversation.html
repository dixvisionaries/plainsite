    <h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Purpose</h5>

    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">

    The purpose of this effort is to ask you to be cyber architects and envision what you think this park (really any park, but, yes this park) would need to to prove its programs, justify itself, interact with the citizens, and help our mental health. This is a brainstorm conversation that will prove the point that we can not only plan for the physical infrastructure of the park but also the cyber infrastructure of the park. We are looking for ideas about gathering data.

    <h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Backstory</h5>
    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    In the 1850s and 60s 70s there was a woman Dorothy Dix who won and earned a grant of land from the North Carolina legislature. I think it was two thousand acres two thousand acres set aside for mental health. It is now whittled down to three hundred acres, so we know this kind of whittling happens over time. Nowadays thereis no longer a mental hospital on campus. It was a necessary decision to move the hospital away from this spot in the middle of Raleigh. A lot of people are still hurt by the lack of a mental health support services.  

    But people involved in the park now see the park as a way to at least do something. Maybe the park can house some of these non-profit agencies that support mental health.  Or another big idea is to provide places for support group meet ups. Maybe you you need a support group,  or maybe you're a caretaker like you care take of somebody with a mental illness like Alzheimer's: you just need a support group. Or spaces for civic engagement meetings.This. idea to use the buildings for support group space  has not really floated to the surface yet, but it's out there. 
    
    What's happening right now with the park is that a master plan has been conceived, but one that is not explicitly consciousness about technology.
</p>
    <h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">How can data drive decisions at Dix Park?</h5>
    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    What technology can or should be put in a park of the future? That's really important because decisions about the park will get made and they can get made using money only, or money augmented with data.
    In the course of my involvement with the park, I asked was how does the City of Raleigh look at Park usage data now? Drawing on my experience in data science, I suggested: Do you count trash bags? Or weighing them would be more meaningful. I must have been reading the news about when the national parks got closed, the trash piled up; definitely there is a correlation between trash and park usage. But I learned there's nothing like that. 
    </p>
    <h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Who You Are</h5>
    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    The main concern here is to collect the perspective of people such as yourself  who understand technological life and justification of a program with data that can transpire as a result of sensors and the internet of things. You can envision this world where an app is part of the park experience, and what needs to happen.
