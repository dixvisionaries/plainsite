<h2 tabindex="0" class="mdc-typography--headline2 b">Population Sensing</h2>


<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Opportunity</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
Our opportunity is to describe how many people use which parts of the Dorothea Dix Park, and if we can, why they do.
</p>


<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Target Clients of the Project</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1"> This park has many decision makers. It is governed by the City of Raleigh.
    Thus, it is supported by local and taxes, but also by voluntary donors, including large foundations. 
    These entities have no purpose without the Dorothea Dix Park visitors, who are chose to visit the park for thier own reasons, and some of whom want to be fully informed while engaging in public discourse about a public park.
    All of these need data to supplement their decision making.
</p>

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Our Market</h5>

<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
The official park tagline is A Park for Everyone, Built by Everyone. On the one hand, that's a large market.
On the other hand, we have to build our collective imagination about who uses the park; in tech parlance, the park's <i>user stories</i><div class="">
    </p>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">For example, Janel is a mother of young twins. Like any mom who wants to give her children great experiences, she offers them choices about a birthday celebration.
However, like any mom dealing with real-world limits, she's happy when her twins want a park party rather than renting special party space or equipment. 
While we envision anonymous sensors to tell us about the picnic table she used, or the extra kids at park that day, we also wonder if Janel would be willing to volunteer more data about her experience: 
she's a mom, who on this day, hosted a birthday pary, to which 10 kids came, with an alternative cost of $100. 
With this story told, any decision maker or donor knows that Janel represent a stack of families that need a park with facilities that meet their needs to build their communities.
</p>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">What's your Dorothea Dix Park story? (We intend to collect these with a blog app.)
</p>


<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Our Solution</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
Yet, for all the stories, the commonality is that individuals came to the Dorothea Dix Park. Physically.
With pedestrian counters installed in different places, we can establish a baseline about park visitors now. We can leave studying the motivations or decisions for a park visit for down the road.
</p>


<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Open Data Use</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
    Our plan is to install infrared sensors that are used to sense Dorothea Dix Park visitors like ones used at other parks.
See <a class="link2" href="https://betacity.ca/2015/11/23/diy-pedestrian-counter/">DIY Pedestrian Counter</a>. 
</p>

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Business Model</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
Our hope is that analysis of the population data about the Dorothea Dix Park will be the proof-of-concepts that inspires the funding and structures to keep the sensors as a permanent part of the park.
</p>

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Other Adjacent Efforts</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
The City of Raleigh used the site <a class="link2" href="https://neighborland.com/dixpark/ideas">Neighborland</a> to collect hundreds of comments about the park. 
The Dix Park Conservancy is another organized body dedicated to the evolution of the Dorothea Dix Park. 
</p>

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Unique Value Proposition</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">Other approaches collected citizen input on paper. Other approaches collected unstructure public comment online. 
Our approach is to collect structure data sets and make them openly available, unlike prior input collections.
</p>

</p>

<h5 class="mdc-typography--headline5">Team Needs</h5>
<p class="mdc-typography--body1">
We are calling for all kinds of volunteers to help this effort go forward. 
Not only do we need technical talent for the implementation of a technical project, but also folks who have a long and vested interest with the Park, Dorothea Dix, and brain health and mindscaping.
For example, where at this 308 acre park exactly do we place these sensors? We need people who can answer that question in many ways, also.
